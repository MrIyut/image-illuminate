   ---Overview---
The Image Illuminate web application is a platform that leverages artificial intelligence to generate images based on user-provided text and additional customization options.
Users can describe the images they want and specify characteristics, and the AI model will generate images accordingly. 
The project aims to provide a creative and interactive experience for users seeking unique visual content.

   ---Functionality---
The web application allows users to:
Input Descriptions: Users can describe the content they want in the generated images through a text prompt.
Negative Descriptions: Users can specify elements they do not want in the images through a separate text prompt.
Select AI Personality: Users can choose from different AI personalities, each associated with a specific label and image. The personality influences the perspective and style of the generated images.
Customize Generation Options: Users can adjust various options such as steps, seed, CFG-scale, samples, and image dimensions to fine-tune the image generation process.
Toggle Dark Mode: The application provides a dark mode for enhanced user experience.
View and Download Generated Images: Users can view the generated images on the web page, and there is an option to download them.

   ---Technologies Used---
The back-end of the web application is built using the Django framework. The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. 
The AI model for image generation used is Stable Diffusion XL.
