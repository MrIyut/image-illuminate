   ---Overview---
The Image Illuminate web application is a platform that leverages artificial intelligence to generate images based on user-provided text and additional customization options.
Users can describe the images they want and specify characteristics, and the AI model will generate images accordingly. 
The project aims to provide a creative and interactive experience for users seeking unique visual content.

   ---Functionality---
The web application allows users to:
Input Descriptions: Users can describe the content they want in the generated images through a text prompt.
Negative Descriptions: Users can specify elements they do not want in the images through a separate text prompt.
Select AI Models: Users can choose from different AI models, each associated with a specific label and image. These models influence the perspective and style of the generated images.
Customize Generation Options: Users can adjust various options such as steps, seed, CFG-scale, samples, and image dimensions to fine-tune the image generation process.
Toggle Dark Mode: The application provides a dark mode for enhanced user experience.
View and Download Generated Images: Users can view the generated images on the web page, and there is an option to download them.

   ---Technologies Used---
The web application is built using the Django framework, a high-level Python web framework. The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. 
The AI models for image generation are not explicitly specified in the provided code, but they are assumed to be integrated as part of the backend logic.


   ---Project Structure---
The project consists of the following components:

-> Django Settings: Configuration settings for the Django project, including database settings, template directories, and static files.
-> HTML Templates: HTML templates define the structure of the web pages, including placeholders for dynamic content.
-> JavaScript: The provided JavaScript code handles user interactions, such as button clicks, model selection, and image generation.
-> CSS: The CSS styles define the visual appearance of the web pages, ensuring a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
